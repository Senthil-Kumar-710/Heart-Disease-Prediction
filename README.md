 # INTRODUCTION
 Heart disease is a prevalent and life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Timely prediction and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective prevention and treatment. Machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools in predicting heart diseases by analyzing patient data and identifying relevant patterns. Two popular machine learning algorithms for this purpose are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees.

This study delves into the realm of healthcare diagnostics, focusing on disease prediction through symptom analysis using two powerful machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree. Traditional methods often struggle with the complexities of symptom data, making machine learning an attractive solution. Leveraging the simplicity of KNN and the ability of Decision Trees to model intricate decision processes, this research aims to develop robust predictive models.

# FEATURES USSED

The features used in a disease prediction model using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and Decision Tree algorithms for symptom analysis typically include various symptoms or clinical indicators that are relevant to the specific disease being predicted. The choice of features depends on the nature of the disease and the available data. Here's a general outline of how features might be selected:

Symptoms:

The primary features are the symptoms exhibited by the user. These could include a wide range of symptoms relevant to the disease under consideration. For example, if predicting a respiratory disease, symptoms might include cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain.
Medical History:

Previous medical history, including information about any existing conditions, past illnesses, surgeries, or chronic diseases, could be important features.
Demographic Information:

Demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity may be considered as factors influencing disease prevalence and presentation.
Vital Signs:

Measurements of vital signs like blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature could be used as features, especially for diseases that manifest in changes to these indicators.
Laboratory Results:

If available, results from laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures could be included. For example, blood tests, imaging results, or biopsy findings may provide valuable information.
Lifestyle Factors:

Information about the user's lifestyle habits, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity, may be relevant for certain diseases.
Environmental Factors:

Factors related to the user's environment, such as geographical location, pollution levels, or occupational exposures, might be considered depending on the disease being predicted.
